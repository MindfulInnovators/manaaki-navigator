## Technical Implementation

The Manaaki Navigator Streamlit MVP is built using:
- **Streamlit**: For the web application framework
- **Python**: For backend logic and conversation handling
- **CSS**: For styling and cultural adaptation
- **Session State**: For maintaining conversation context

The application structure follows a modular design:
- `app.py`: Main application and chat interface
- `pages/`: Additional pages (About, Testing)
- `services/`: Backend logic (conversation, mock data)
- `utils/`: Utility functions (language, styling)

## Future Development Opportunities

1. **Data Integration**: Connect to real service directories and databases
2. **Advanced NLP**: Implement true natural language understanding
3. **User Accounts**: Add personalization and saved preferences
4. **Additional Languages**: Expand to support Pacific languages
5. **Mobile App**: Develop a dedicated mobile application
6. **Offline Support**: Enable functionality without internet connection
7. **Integration APIs**: Connect with healthcare and social service systems
